                <h2 class="section-title">Motivation and Scope</h2>
                <p>
                    As <span class="highlight">autonomous and intelligent agents</span> rapidly
                    emerge as a mainstream phenomenon in both virtual environments and the physical
                    world, they interact and collaborate with humans routinely in a multimodal
                    fashion, encompassing physical entities such as collaborative robots, smart
                    glasses, and industrial IoT sensors. These autonomous agents are capable of
                    real-time perception of their surroundings and can take actions &mdash; but both
                    their perception and their decisions critically depend on an
                    <span class="highlight"
                        >efficient, low-latency, highly dependable, and adaptive network
                        infrastructure</span
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In both virtual and physical environments, with the ubiquity of tool use (e.g.,
                    via the Model Context Protocol), the ways in which autonomous agents interact
                    and network with one another will inevitably evolve beyond traditional data
                    transport and connectivity, and become an
                    <span class="highlight">embodied intelligence network</span> with agentic
                    workflows. Such a network resembles an intelligent mesh consisting of actors
                    that communicate with each other by message passing, running agents who are
                    capable of perceiving and adapting to the environment, understanding human
                    intent, coordinating multi-agent activities, and providing semantic
                    communication with real-time control loops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workshop aims to provide an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and
                    professionals from academia and industry to exchange ideas concerning the
                    network architectures, protocols, algorithms, and system designs for embodied
                    intelligence networks in the near future. We encourage submissions of
                    forward-looking research, novel system designs, and practical deployment
                    experiences that deeply integrate networking with embodied perception,
                    reasoning, and action. Papers with open-source artifacts &mdash; including
                    source code and datasets &mdash; are especially welcome and strongly encouraged.
                    The freshness of visionary ideas is more important than the completeness of
                    theoretical proofs, and simplicity may not be inferior to complexity.
