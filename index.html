                <p>
                    AI, as Andrej Karpathy referred to in
                    <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1744179910347039080?s=20"
                        >his tweet last January</a
                    >
                    as <span class="highlight">“IA (intelligence amplification)”</span>, is more
                    than just independent long-running agents. It increasingly has the vibe of tools
                    for thought, needing human interaction. Karpathy’s vision has quickly become a
                    reality of Embodied Intelligence, where autonomous agents are increasingly
                    moving from virtual environments into the physical world, interacting with
                    humans, encompassing physical entities such as collaborative robots, smart
                    glasses, and industrial IoT sensors. These autonomous agents are capable of
                    real-time perception of their surroundings, and can take actions—but both their
                    perception and their decisions critically depend on an efficient, low-latency,
                    highly dependable, and adaptive network infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In both virtual and physical environments, with the ubiquity of tool use (e.g.,
                    via the Model Context Protocol), the ways how autonomous agents interact and
                    network with one another will inevitably evolve beyond traditional data
                    transport and connectivity, and become an
                    <span class="highlight">embodied intelligence network</span> with agentic
                    workflows. Such a network resembles an intelligent mesh consisting of actors
                    that communicate with each other by message passing, running agents who are
                    capable of perceiving and adapting to the environment, understanding human
                    intent, coordinating multi-agent activities, and providing semantic
                    communication with real-time control loops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This new workshop aims to focus squarely on exciting ideas in the emerging topic
                    of agentic computing, as well as how networking can adapt to the needs of
                    agentic computing, in both virtual and phyiscal environments. We encourage
                    submissions of forward-looking research, novel system designs, and practical
                    deployment experiences that deeply integrate networking with embodied
                    perception, reasoning, and action. Papers with open-source artifacts &mdash;
                    including source code and datasets &mdash; are especially welcome and strongly
                    encouraged. The freshness of visionary an forward-looking ideas is more
                    important than the completeness of theoretical proofs, and simplicity may not be
                    inferior to complexity.

                <p>
                    EIN sits at the intersection of agentic computing and next-generation
                    networking. It asks how networks should evolve as embodied intelligence becomes
                    mainstream and agents become ubiquitous—across edge, cloud, and physical
                    environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop builds on prior work in distributed and federated learning, but
                    focuses specifically on the networking challenges of real-time control loops,
                    ultra-low-latency coordination, semantic communication, and multi-agent
                    orchestration for embodied systems.
